# CryptoLedger - A Basic Blockchain Implementation

CryptoLedger is a simple blockchain and cryptocurrency project built using React for the frontend and Python for the backend. The project allows users to interact with a blockchain by adding blocks, viewing the current blockchain data, and validating the blockchain’s integrity.

## Features

- **View Blockchain Data**: Displays the entire blockchain and its blocks.
- **Validate Blockchain**: Checks the validity of the blockchain by ensuring that all blocks are properly linked and the data is correct.
- **Add Multiple Blocks**: Allows users to add multiple blocks to the blockchain with custom data.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
crypto-ledger/
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── AddBlock.js
│   │   ├── ViewChain.js
│   │   └── ValidateChain.js
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.css
│   └── index.js
└── package.json
```

## Requirements

- **React** for building the frontend
- **Flask (Python)** for the backend to implement the blockchain logic
- **Node.js** and **npm** for package management
- A running instance of the backend API for interacting with the blockchain

## Installation

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-ledger.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd crypto-ledger
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the React app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the backend repository (if it's separate) or use the existing backend code provided in the project.

2. Set up the Flask application by installing the necessary Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Components

### 1. **AddBlock**
   - Allows the user to add a new block to the blockchain with custom data.

### 2. **ViewChain**
   - Displays the current blockchain by fetching data from the backend API.

### 3. **ValidateChain**
   - Validates the blockchain by checking its integrity and returns whether the chain is valid.

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /get_chain`: Fetches the entire blockchain.
- `POST /add_block`: Adds a new block to the blockchain.
- `GET /is_chain_valid`: Validates the current blockchain.


## Summary of  Features

- **View Blockchain**: Displays the entire blockchain with details of each block (index, data, hash, previous hash, and timestamp).
- **Validate Blockchain**: Allows users to validate the blockchain with the `/is_chain_valid` endpoint and checks for consistency.
- **Add Block**: Users can add blocks to the blockchain with custom data through the frontend interface.
